        <h1>Gear Recommendations</h1>
            <p>Keeping your equipment up-to-date is crucial. Insufficient gear can hinder your damage output and survivability. Aim to have gear that matches your current level or is only slightly lower.</p>
            <p>While progressing through the Main Scenario Quest (MSQ), you will frequently acquire gear upgrades and coffers to keep your setup competitive.</p>
            <p>For leveling outside the MSQ, gear can be obtained through vendors (using Gil), the Market Board, or by trading Tomestones and Poetics earned through roulettes and other activities.</p>

            <h3>Gear Recommendations by Key Levels:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Level 50:</strong> Augmented Ironworks Gear (IL 130) – Obtain from Auriana in Mor Dhona or Rowena's Representatives in the main cities.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Level 60:</strong> Augmented Shire Gear (IL 270) – Available from Hismena in Idyllshire.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Level 70:</strong> Augmented Scaevan Gear (IL 400) – Obtainable from Enna in Rhalgr's Reach.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Level 80:</strong> Augmented Cryptlurker Gear (IL 530) – Purchase from Aymark in Eulmore.</p></li>

        <h3>Other EXP Buffs</h3>
        <h6>Food</h6>
        <p>Make sure to always have a <strong>Food</strong> buff up whiel leveling. Food Buff gives 3% increase to EXP and is very easy to obtain. I recommend buying <strong>Boiled Eggs</strong> from a merchant to use for the EXP Since they are cheap.</p>
        <h6>FC Buff</h6>
        <p>If you are not a trial player, you have the option to join or create and FC (Free Company). Free Companies are FFXIV's version of Guilds. An FC has the ability to have different Active buffs. Having Either <strong>Heat of Battle II</strong> or <strong>Heat of Battle III</strong> active will increase your EXP gained by 10% or 15%</p>
        <h6>Rested EXP</h6>
        <p>Make sure you are taking breaks! By taking breaks from the game and logging out in a safe zone with an Aetheryte or Inn you will get <strong>Rested EXP</strong>. You can store up to one and half levels worth of <strong>Rested EXP</strong> and you increase your EXP gained by 50% for all monster kills.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>How to Level</h3>
        <p>If you job starts at level 1 the best way to level up is to do Fates and your Hunt Log.</p>
        <p>Once you reach level 15 you can start doing dungeons! Running the highest level dungeon available to you is the fastest way to level up.</p>
