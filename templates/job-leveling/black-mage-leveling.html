    <div id="blm_gear">
        <h1>Gear Recommendations</h1>
        <div id="blm_txt">
            <p>Keeping your gear up-to-date is essential. Without proper gear, your damage contribution will suffer. Ideally, your equipment should match your current level, or be no more than a few levels behind.</p>
            <p>If you’re progressing through the Main Scenario Quest (MSQ), you’ll regularly earn gear upgrades and coffers to keep your setup competitive.</p>
            <p>For leveling outside the MSQ, you can acquire gear through merchants (using Gil), the Market Board, or by exchanging Tomestones and Poetics earned through roulettes and other activities.</p>

            <h3>Gear Recommendations by Key Levels:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Level 50:</strong> Augmented Ironworks Gear (IL 130) – Available from Auriana in Mor Dhona.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Level 60:</strong> Augmented Shire Gear (IL 270) – Purchase from Hismena in Idyllshire.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Level 70:</strong> Augmented Scaevan Gear (IL 400) – Buy from Enna in Rhalgr’s Reach.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Level 80:</strong> Augmented Cryptlurker Gear (IL 530) – Obtain from Aymark in Eulmore.</p></li>

    <div id="blm_tips">
        <h1>General Tips for Black Mage</h1>
        <div id="blm_txt">
            <p><strong>Rotation Mastery:</strong> Black Mage heavily focuses on maintaining a seamless flow between your Astral Fire and Umbral Ice phases.</p>
            <p><strong>DoT Management:</strong> Always refresh your Thunder DoT whenever it expires, ensuring that you're keeping up maximum damage over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Positioning:</strong> Black Mage has limited mobility, so careful positioning is key. Use Aetherial Manipulation to adjust your placement when necessary.</p>
            <p><strong>Ley Lines:</strong> Drop Ley Lines in safe spots, as they significantly boost your spellcasting speed. Try to stay inside them for as long as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Triplecast:</strong> Use Triplecast during movement-heavy mechanics to keep your damage output high while you’re repositioning.</p>
            <p><strong>Managing Enochian:</strong> Maintain Enochian by alternating your fire and ice phases effectively.</p>

    <div id="blm_rotation">
        <h1>Rotation Overview</h1>
        <div id="blm_txt">
            <p>Black Mage’s rotation focuses on swapping between Fire and Ice phases. In Astral Fire, you'll deal massive damage with Fire spells, while Umbral Ice restores your MP for another burst phase.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Single Target Rotation</h3>
        <div id="blm_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>Start with <strong>Blizzard III</strong> → <strong>Blizzard IV</strong> to enter Umbral Ice.</p></li>
                <li><p>Switch to <strong>Fire III</strong> → <strong>Fire IV</strong> x3, refresh your Astral Fire timer with <strong>Paradox</strong>, and cast another three <strong>Fire IV</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p>End your Astral Fire phase with <strong>Despair</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Xenoglossy</strong> as it becomes available to prevent overcapping.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cast <strong>Paradox</strong> when in Umbral Ice for additional MP recovery and damage.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Multi-Target Rotation</h3>
        <div id="blm_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>Alternate <strong>Thunder</strong> DoTs on multiple targets to maintain uptime.</p></li>
                <li><p>For AoE, use <strong>Blizzard II</strong> → <strong>Freeze</strong> followed by <strong>Fire II</strong> x3 → <strong>Flare</strong> x2.</p></li>
                <li><p>Refresh <strong>Thunder II</strong> as needed and use <strong>Foul</strong> for both weaving and movement purposes.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Off-Global Cooldowns and Utility</h3>
        <div id="blm_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Transpose</strong> to switch between Fire and Ice phases when needed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Manaward</strong> can help mitigate incoming damage.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Manafont</strong> allows you to extend your Fire phase by cutting out an Ice phase.</p></li>
                <li><p>Utilize <strong>Ley Lines</strong> and reposition them with <strong>Retrace</strong> if necessary.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Between the Lines</strong> to quickly return to your Ley Lines after movement.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Triplecast</strong> is ideal for casting your most powerful spells instantly, especially during movement.</p></li>
                <li><p>Make use of <strong>Amplifier</strong> to generate a Polyglot stack for <strong>Foul</strong> or <strong>Xenoglossy</strong>.</p></li>
            </ul>
