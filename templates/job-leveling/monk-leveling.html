        <h1>Gear Recommendations</h1>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <p>Gear is critical to ensuring that your Monk performs well at all levels. Keeping your gear updated as you level will significantly improve your damage and survivability. While progressing through the Main Scenario Quest (MSQ), you will receive gear upgrades naturally, but gear from vendors, the Market Board, and Tomestones are also excellent sources.</p>

    <div id="mnk_tips">
        <h1>General Tips for Monk</h1>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <p><strong>Master Your Positioning:</strong> Many of Monk's abilities have positional bonuses. To maximize your damage, always aim to hit the rear or flank of your enemies when using these skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Keep Up Your Buffs:</strong> Always keep <strong>Twin Snakes</strong> active to maintain your damage buff. This is a key part of the Monk rotation, and forgetting to refresh it will drastically reduce your effectiveness.</p>
            <p><strong>Utilize Chakra Efficiently:</strong> Use <strong>The Forbidden Chakra</strong> as soon as you reach five stacks of Chakra. Overcapping on Chakra (gaining additional Chakra while already at 5 stacks) is a waste of potential damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Cooldown Management:</strong> Align <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong> with <strong>Brotherhood</strong> to maximize burst damage during windows where both are active. Weaving <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> and <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> into these cooldowns is essential for high damage output.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Don't forget that Monk has a few defensive tools, such as <strong>Riddle of Earth</strong>, to mitigate incoming damage and help the team survive tough encounters.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="mnk_rotation">
        <h1>Rotation Overview</h1>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <p>Monk's rotation revolves around maintaining buffs, managing your Chakra system, and effectively using your abilities based on the encounter. Below are simplified rotations for both single-target and multi-target scenarios as you level up.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Base GCD Weaponskill Rotation</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <p>Monk's core rotation is built on a three-step combo, alternating between two sets of weaponskills based on positional bonuses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Start with <strong>Dragon Kick</strong> (or <strong>Leaping Opo</strong>), then alternate with <strong>Twin Snakes</strong> (or <strong>Rising Raptor</strong>), and use <strong>Demolish</strong> to finish the combo.</p></li>
                <li><p>Refresh <strong>Twin Snakes</strong> every 15 seconds to keep the damage buff active.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Demolish</strong> whenever the DoT is about to expire.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Buffing Actions</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Perfect Balance:</strong> Use after an Opo-Opo form GCD to maximize your combo potential.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Riddle of Fire:</strong> Time this cooldown with <strong>Brotherhood</strong> and <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> to deliver powerful bursts.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Riddle of Wind:</strong> Use this strictly on cooldown, aligning it where possible with <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong>.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Chakra System</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>At level 74, <strong>Deep Meditation II</strong> gives a 100% chance to generate Chakra on a critical hit. This means you want to use <strong>The Forbidden Chakra</strong> or <strong>Enlightenment</strong> whenever you have 5 Chakra stacks.</p></li>
                <li><p>Avoid overcapping on Chakra to prevent wasting potential damage output.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Multi-Target Rotation</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>For four or more targets, switch to AoE skills like <strong>Shadow of the Destroyer</strong>, <strong>Four-point Fury</strong>, and <strong>Rockbreaker</strong>.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Multi-Target Perfect Balance Usage</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>In multi-target situations, generate <strong>Elixir Burst</strong> and <strong>Tornado Kick</strong> by using three <strong>Shadow of the Destroyer</strong> actions within <strong>Perfect Balance</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Rising Phoenix</strong> whenever possible to deal massive AoE damage.</p></li>
            </ul>
