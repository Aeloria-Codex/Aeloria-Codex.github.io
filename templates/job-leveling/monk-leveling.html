        <h1>General Tips for Monk</h1>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <p><strong>Master Your Positioning:</strong> Many of Monk's abilities have positional bonuses. To maximize your damage, always aim to hit the rear or flank of your enemies when using these skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Keep Up Your Buffs:</strong> Always keep <strong>Twin Snakes</strong> active to maintain your damage buff. This is a key part of the Monk rotation, and forgetting to refresh it will drastically reduce your effectiveness.</p>
            <p><strong>Utilize Chakra Efficiently:</strong> Use <strong>The Forbidden Chakra</strong> as soon as you reach five stacks of Chakra. Overcapping on Chakra (gaining additional Chakra while already at 5 stacks) is a waste of potential damage.</p>
            <p><strong>Cooldown Management:</strong> Align <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong> with <strong>Brotherhood</strong> to maximize burst damage during windows where both are active. Weaving <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> and <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> into these cooldowns is essential for high damage output.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Don't forget that Monk has a few defensive tools, such as <strong>Riddle of Earth</strong>, to mitigate incoming damage and help the team survive tough encounters.</p>

        <h1>Rotation Overview</h1>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <p>Monk's rotation revolves around maintaining buffs, managing your Chakra system, and effectively using your abilities based on the encounter. Below are simplified rotations for both single-target and multi-target scenarios as you level up.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Base GCD Weaponskill Rotation</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <p>Monk's core rotation is built on a three-step combo, alternating between two sets of weaponskills based on positional bonuses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Start with <strong>Dragon Kick</strong> (or <strong>Leaping Opo</strong>), then alternate with <strong>Twin Snakes</strong> (or <strong>Rising Raptor</strong>), and use <strong>Demolish</strong> to finish the combo.</p></li>
                <li><p>Refresh <strong>Twin Snakes</strong> every 15 seconds to keep the damage buff active.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Demolish</strong> whenever the DoT is about to expire.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Buffing Actions</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Perfect Balance:</strong> Use after an Opo-Opo form GCD to maximize your combo potential.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Riddle of Fire:</strong> Time this cooldown with <strong>Brotherhood</strong> and <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> to deliver powerful bursts.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Riddle of Wind:</strong> Use this strictly on cooldown, aligning it where possible with <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong>.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Chakra System</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>At level 74, <strong>Deep Meditation II</strong> gives a 100% chance to generate Chakra on a critical hit. This means you want to use <strong>The Forbidden Chakra</strong> or <strong>Enlightenment</strong> whenever you have 5 Chakra stacks.</p></li>
                <li><p>Avoid overcapping on Chakra to prevent wasting potential damage output.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Multi-Target Rotation</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>For four or more targets, switch to AoE skills like <strong>Shadow of the Destroyer</strong>, <strong>Four-point Fury</strong>, and <strong>Rockbreaker</strong>.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Multi-Target Perfect Balance Usage</h3>
        <div id="mnk_txt">
            <ul>
                <li><p>In multi-target situations, generate <strong>Elixir Burst</strong> and <strong>Tornado Kick</strong> by using three <strong>Shadow of the Destroyer</strong> actions within <strong>Perfect Balance</strong>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Rising Phoenix</strong> whenever possible to deal massive AoE damage.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
