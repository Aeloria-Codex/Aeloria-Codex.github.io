        <h1>General Tips for Machinist</h1>
        <div id="mch_txt">
            <p><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Keep an eye on your Heat and Battery gauges to ensure you don't waste resources. Use Hypercharge before the Heat Gauge maxes out, and summon Automaton Queen before the Battery Gauge fills completely.</p>
            <p><strong>Reassemble:</strong> Always pair Reassemble with your strongest available attack, such as Drill or Air Anchor, to maximize damage output.</p>
            <p><strong>Cooldown Timing:</strong> Align offensive cooldowns like Wildfire with powerful abilities to deal significant damage during bursts. Pairing them with group raid buffs can further enhance your performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Utilize the Machinist's mitigation tools like Dismantle and Tactician to support your team and reduce incoming damage in both dungeon and raid settings.</p>
