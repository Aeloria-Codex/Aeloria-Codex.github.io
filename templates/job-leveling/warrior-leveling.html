    <h1>General Tips for Warrior</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Warrior is a powerful melee DPS known for its high damage output and ability to tank in a pinch. It's a great choice for players who like to be in the thick of the action.</p>
        <p>Early levels focus on building up your "Inner Beast" gauge and using your basic attacks to deal damage. </p>
        <p>Unlocking the "Inner Release" ability at level 15 is a game-changer. It lets you unleash a burst of damage and activate your "Inner Release" mode, increasing your attack power. </p>
        <p>Learn to weave in your combo skills between basic attacks, focusing on building up "Inner Beast" as fast as possible. </p>
        <p>At level 30, you gain access to the powerful "Fell Cleave" ability, which is a powerful AoE attack that's great for dealing with multiple enemies.</p>
        <p>Learn the importance of managing your "Inner Beast" gauge and using it to maximize your damage output.</p>
        <p>Your job quests will provide valuable new abilities, including the critical "Stormblood" ability, which allows you to unleash a devastating attack and increase your attack power.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye on your "Blood Gauge" and use it to heal yourself when necessary. </p>
        <p>Don't be afraid to use your "Overpower" ability to deal extra damage when you need to. </p>
