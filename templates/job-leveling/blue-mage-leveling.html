        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Blue Mage is a limted job and becuase of that this leveling page is going to be very differnt from the rest.</p>
        <p>There videos to watch on how to level BlU but I will not be showing them off here.</p>

        <p>Blue Mage begins its journey at level 1, with a maximum level cap of 80. Unlike other jobs, Blue Mage's leveling experience is quite different. It benefits from a significant experience boost (10x) when defeating open-world enemies and cannot participate in standard roulettes through the Duty Finder. Because of this, the fastest way to level is by taking down enemies in the open world!</p>
        <p>There are three methods of leveling up: being powerleveled by someone at max level, powerleveling yourself, or manually solo leveling by killing enemies around your level until you reach level cap. It's important to note that there is no practical benefit to manually leveling solo—it takes significantly longer, and you won’t learn how to play Blue Mage while leveling. The real experience begins at max level, so it's best to reach it as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>Learning spells from enemies is a core aspect of Blue Mage's progression. The actual process of leveling to 80 is more of a formality.</p>

        <h3>Blue Mage Leveling Locations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Level 80 Locations: Labyrinthos (Caribou in northwest Labyrinthos, X:12, Y:8)</p></li>
            <li><p>Level 70 Locations: The Tempest</p></li>
            <li><p>Level 60 Locations: Labyrinthos</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Caribou are an ideal target for leveling as they are melee-only, making survival easier. If the person being powerleveled doesn't have access to Endwalker, use the highest available enemies for their level.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="group-powerleveling">
        <h3>Group Powerleveling</h3>
        <p>Blue Mage gets a massive bonus to experience when defeating open-world enemies up to level 80. The most efficient way to level up is to tag an enemy with a low-level Blue Mage and have a max-level player defeat it. This method grants the full experience to the Blue Mage.</p>
        <p>Ensure the Blue Mage is not in the same party as the max-level player, as being in a party would reduce experience gained. Cross-world parties are fine, and multiple Blue Mages can level up together if they are close in level.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="preparation">
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>Learning <strong>Flying Sardine</strong> is helpful as it’s a no-cast-time ranged attack. It can be learned from Apkallu in Eastern La Noscea (X:27, Y:35).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="the-process">
        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>The Blue Mage tags an enemy, and the max-level player kills it. This process repeats until the Blue Mage reaches level 80. Shield healers or fast DPS jobs like Machinist are recommended for max-level players.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="group-gearing">
        <h4>Gearing While Leveling</h4>
        <p>Your gear doesn’t matter while being powerleveled. You can go from level 1 to 80 with no gear at all.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="group-time">
        <h4>Time Taken</h4>
        <p>Powerleveling from 1 to 80 takes about an hour, with experience buffs like food, manuals, and expansion preorder earrings speeding up the process.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="solo-powerleveling">
        <h3>Solo Powerleveling</h3>
        <p>In The Tempest, you can solo powerlevel by using an interesting interaction between Leeches and Clionids. The Clionids will eat the Leeches, but if the Blue Mage tags the Leech first, they will get the experience.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="solo-process">
        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>Aggro a Leech, pull it toward a Clionid, let the Clionid kill it, and gain the experience. Be careful not to overfeed a Clionid, as it will grow and become deadly.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="solo-time">
        <h4>Time Taken</h4>
        <p>Solo powerleveling takes about an hour, and using experience buffs will reduce the time.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="solo-leveling">
        <h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
        <p>The solo leveling process involves killing enemies around your level.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Before 1000 Needles:</strong> Kill enemies until you reach a level where you can learn <strong>1000 Needles</strong> (level 20).</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1000 Needles:</strong> Use the <strong>1000 Needles</strong> spell to quickly defeat enemies until it becomes less efficient than using standard spells.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>After 1000 Needles:</strong> Switch to a more powerful spell like <strong>The Ram's Voice</strong> or <strong>Choco Meteor</strong> at level 50.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h4>Gearing While Leveling</h4>

    <section id="solo-time">
        <h4>Time Taken</h4>
        <p>Solo leveling can take many hours. There is no practical benefit to leveling this way, but it is included as an option for those who prefer it.</p>
