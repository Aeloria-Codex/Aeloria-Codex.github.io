        <h1>General Tips for Astrologian</h1>
        <div id="ast_txt">
            <p><strong>Starting at level 30:</strong> Keep in mind that Astrologian begins at level 30, but your level may and will be synced down in lower-level content.</p>
            <p><strong>Job Quests:</strong> Always complete your job quests! They unlock essential skills and abilities as you level up.</p>
            <p><strong>Keep casting:</strong> Even as a healer, you should always aim to deal damage when healing isn’t required.</p>
            <p><strong>Lucid Dreaming:</strong> Manage your MP by using Lucid Dreaming at around 80-85% MP.</p>
            <p><strong>Lightspeed:</strong> Use Lightspeed to maintain uptime while moving or to cast faster in tight situations.</p>
            <p><strong>Esuna:</strong> Keep an eye on debuffs and use Esuna to remove them when necessary.</p>
            <p><strong>Swiftcast and Revives:</strong> Use Swiftcast to revive allies, but if it’s on cooldown, don’t hesitate to hard-cast Ascend.</p>

            <h3>Card Management and Gauge Usage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Astral Draw/Umbral Draw:</strong> Regularly use these to draw cards and replenish MP.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Play I, II, III:</strong> Use these cards to boost damage, defense, or healing for your party members.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Balance:</strong> Increases party member damage for a short time.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Arrow:</strong> Provides healing buffs.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Spire:</strong> Grants shielding.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Lord of Crowns:</strong> Use for strong AoE damage.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Lady of Crowns:</strong> Offers a group heal.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Single-Target Damage Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Combust III:</strong> Maintain DoT on your target whenever it will tick for at least 12 seconds.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fall Malefic:</strong> Cast this regularly to maximize damage output.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Divination:</strong> Use during burst windows to amplify party damage.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>AoE Damage Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Combust III:</strong> Apply this DoT on multiple targets for prolonged engagements.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Gravity II:</strong> Use on 3 or more targets; otherwise, cast Fall Malefic.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Divination + Lord of Crowns:</strong> Combine these for a potent AoE burst during large pulls.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Single-Target Healing Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Use <strong>The Spire</strong>, <strong>The Bole</strong>, and <strong>The Ewer</strong> on the tank when they’re taking damage.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>The Arrow</strong> can boost healing on the tank or another target, especially if timed with regens or shields.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use <strong>Exaltation</strong> on the tank during pulls to reduce damage, but avoid overlapping it with their strongest cooldowns or invulnerability.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Essential Dignity</strong> is your go-to single-target heal. Use it freely rather than saving it for emergencies.</p></li>
                <li><p>With three charges, <strong>Essential Dignity</strong> allows more flexibility for emergencies while keeping the other charges in use.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Celestial Intersection</strong> is best for tank upkeep thanks to its shield and short cooldown. Use it whenever possible.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>AoE Healing Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Earthly Star</strong> primarily serves as a damage source in dungeons but also provides AoE healing when detonated strategically.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Collective Unconscious</strong> offers instant mitigation and healing, allowing you to keep casting while moving.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Celestial Opposition</strong> offers higher potency than Collective Unconscious. Use it when party-wide healing is needed.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Lady of Crowns</b> provides instant healing, equaling <b>Helios</b> in potency but lacks the additional benefits offered by <b>Celestial Opposition</b>.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Horoscope</b> delivers a 200-potency heal on a short cooldown. While modest, it effectively bridges healing gaps between other off-global cooldown abilities.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Macrocosmos</b> functions as both a multi-target DPS increase and a potent AoE heal, capable of fully restoring a tank’s HP when under heavy damage.</p></li>                
            </ul>
