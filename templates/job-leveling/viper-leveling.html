    <h1>General Tips for Viper</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Viper is a powerful ranged physical DPS known for its quick, deadly strikes and potent poisons.</p>
        <p>Early levels focus on building up your poison stacks and using your basic attacks to deal damage. </p>
        <p>Keep an eye on your Venom gauge and use it strategically to apply poisons and unleash powerful combos.</p>
        <p>Unlocking the "Serpent's Kiss" ability at level 15 is a game-changer. It lets you apply a potent poison that will drastically increase your damage output.</p>
        <p>Learn to weave in your DoTs between basic attacks and combos. Your DoTs are a crucial source of your damage, especially later in the game.</p>
        <p>At level 30, you gain access to the powerful "Serpent's Bite" ability. This ability gives you a stronger poison stack, significantly increasing your damage output. </p>
        <p>Learn the importance of building up your venom gauge and managing your poison stacks to maximize your DPS.</p>
        <p>Your job quests will provide valuable new abilities, including the critical "Viper's Bite," which allows you to unleash a devastating attack at the cost of some Venom.</p>
