        <h1>Gear</h1>
        <div id="leveling_txt">
            <p>Gear is very important for healers to ensure that you are doing enough healing and enough damage each pull.
                Please make an effort to ensure that your gear is realatively close to your currently level.
                It is ok for it to be a few levels lower than what you are currently at,but once you start doing content with gear that is more than 10 levels lower than your current gear, 
                it will start to get very difficult.</p>
            <p>If you are leveling this job fresh through the MSQ (Main Scenaio Quest), you will be rewarded with gear and coffers that will give you better gear for that this job.</p>
            <p>If you are not leveling this job fresh through MSQ (Main Scenaio Quest), then you will get gear other ways. Some of these ways include buying gear from merchants for Gil,
                buying gear from the Market Board for Gil, or using Tomestones and Poetics that you get from running roulettes.</p>
            <p>You can exchange Tomestones for gear every 10 levels starting at level 50.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Level 50:</b> Augmented Ironworks gear (Item Level 130) can be purchased from <b>Auriana in Mor Dhona (X:23, Y:7)</b> 
                    or from any of Rowena's Representatives in Ul'dah - Steps of Nald (X:9, Y:8), New Gridania (X:12, Y:12), or Limsa Lominsa Lower Decks (X:9, Y:11)</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Level 60:</b> Augmented Shire gear (Item Level 270) can be purchased from <b>Hismena in Idyllshire (X:6, Y:5)</b> 
                    or from Rowena's Representative in Ishgard - Foundation (X:11, Y:12).</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Level 70:</b> Augmented Scaevan gear (Item Level 400) can be purchased from <b>Enna in Rhalgr's Reach (X:13.8, Y:11.8).</b></p></li>

        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <div id="leveling_txt">
            <p>A quick reminder, Astrologian starts at level 30 but you can and will be sometimes synced down to level 15</p>
            <p><b>Do your Job Quest!</b> Job quest are really important and you need to make sure that you are doing them so you unlock your new spells/abilities.
                You should have Job Quest at level 40,45,50,54,58, and 60.</p>
            <p>As a healer, you are the support of the party, but that does not mean you shouldnt be doing damage. <b>Always be casting!</b> This is a common phrase you will always hear.
                If you are not having to cast a heal you should be casting damage spells/abilities.</p>
            <p>Make sure to use your <b>Lucid Dreaming</b> ability. This ability will allow you to maintain your MP. It can be used as early as 80-85% MP without over-capping as long as you
                are continuing to cast</p>
            <p>Dont forget your ability <b>Lightspeed</b>, it is used to maintain GCD uptime when you have to move and it can also help speed up and hard-cast.</p>
            <p>Make sure you are wating the party to see when people need healing and to be buffed and have debuffs removed. To remove a debuff use <b>Ensuna</b></p>
            <p>If do not have <b>Swiftcast</b> then make sure to use <b>Ascend</b></p>
            <p>Make sure to use <b>Swiftcast</b> to bypass the long cast time of reviving someone. If Swiftcast is unavailable, it is still almost always worth hard casting the spell to 
                raise them as soon as you have the chance. The only time it is better to wait for Swiftcast is if its remaining cooldown is less than about 10 seconds</p>
